Problem statement is defined in the file "Bungee Coding Round.docx". Please refer to this file. 

I choose python language to solve the problems and used the panda library to work with the csvfiles by converting them to dataframes and viceversa. 
I used the cells of jupyter notebook provided by Anaconda which is installed on my local machine to run my code snippets and solve the problems.
(Note: If you want to run the cell again please check with the input csvfile path which may differ from mine)
